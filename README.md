# MagiStory
## Introduction
MagiStory is a web application designed to address the challenge of language loss among second-generation children in Canada. These children often struggle with maintaining their cultural heritage due to a disconnect from their parents' native languages.

## Problem Defined
Second-generation children living in English-speaking countries are losing touch with their parents’ mother tongues, leading to a significant loss in cultural connection and communication barriers within families.

## User Research Story
- **Cultural Disconnection**: 2nd-gen children in Canada are increasingly losing touch with their cultures.
- **Communication Challenges**: Many of these children are unable to communicate effectively with their grandparents and, in some cases, their parents.
- **Lack of Motivation**: There is a noticeable lack of motivation among these children to learn their parents’ languages, exacerbating the issue.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to provide interactive and appealing storybooks to children to expedite language acquisition. By integrating learning into engaging activities, we aim to foster a deeper connection between children and their cultural heritage.

## Web Application Features
- **Interactive Story Creation**: Allows children to choose or input keywords in five categories: Animal, Dessert, Color, Sport, and Superhero.
- **Language Integration**: Generates a story in Mandarin based on the selected keywords.
- **Visual Engagement**: Accompanies each story with a cartoon image depicting the narrative, enhancing the learning experience.
